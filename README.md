# MassPeople

Mass People - Software for Control and Management of a big mass of persons 
At big events, like "Notti Bianche", fairs, festivals etc, we can often observe how in some areas we have a high concentration of people, while others are practically empty.
This is a discomfort both for clients and for who provides the service (Bar keeper, traders...) .
MassPeople is designed for the Organizators of this big events.
Those can propose at the clients to download the MassPeopleApp, such to collect their position and estimate the distribution of people on the event: MassPeople analyze then the collected data, and eventually tries to conform the people distribution on the event with appropriate offers to the user, so that thay move on the empty parts.
